	 <br><b>Video Script Introduction:</b><br>
		The Start up screen titled "Parts crib Database + Non-Usb Barcode Scanner by my name will follow by brief introduction of the project.<br><br>
		
		A recent study on how equipment and tools are been borrowed from Part cribs of the engineering department shown that the process is not well organised, and not in line with the new technology.
                A projection of how students increase per year shown that at some point the manual way of lending this equipment will not be a better option.
	        I therefore want to introduce part cribs database which am focusing more on the hardware Non Usb Barcode scanner. This is a machine-readable strip of data printed in parallel lines, 
	        used to represent a multitude of information. Traditionally, the barcode scanner is meant to keep track of inventory and speed up data entry. 
	        Due to high volume of student usage, barcode scanning provide easy access, focusing on improving the efficiency, 
	        accuracy, and productivity of supply management. In contrast, I want to create an application that is users friendly. This application would function as a reader of barcode of student identity card.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the parts that arrived:</b><br>
	        These are the component which will fit together to build the entire project. I odered my parts from two different places. My raspberry pi 3 with its component
	        arrived at the cost of $98.00 from amazone with free shipping, Barcode scanner non usb arrived from Robotshop at the cost of almost $100.00 with shipping cost, 
	        I got my sd card from the source. They all arrived one week interver.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the parts assembly:</b><br>
		In other to assemble this part together, we will need some equipments for connection.
	       <li>Ethernet Cable</li>
	       <li>Usb to Ethernet cable adapter</li>
	       <li>HDMI cable with a VGA to Computer</li>
               <li>Identity card barcode</li> 
	        I started by setting up the raspberry pie with the PCB attached, 
	        I connected the internet cable to the raspberry pie to share connection with a device e.g Laptop,
	        I Connect the internet cable through the usb to ethernet cable adapter to the Laptop,
	        In other to view the raspberry pie on the computer I made use of HDMI cable with a VGA to the computer.
	        The non-usb barcode scanner is connected with one of the port in the raspberry pie.
	        Then I connected the power adapter and put the raspberry up.
	        At this stage the identity card barcode is ready for scanning.
	 
	      
		<b>A few seconds of the power up and the functionality you plan to demonstrate:</b><br>
		After connecting the Raspberry Pi’s power adapter for power up, we can switch views on the computer’s VGA settings till we can see the 
		Raspberry Pi’s power up process during load up. We’ll open up the Pi’s command line terminal and then load up the program files and scripts 
		needed to activate the USB barcode scanner’s functionality. At the moment, all we’re trying to do is ensure that the USB Barcode scanner can 
		successfully scan in printed barcode IDs into a web application’s text field and we already have a web application we can use to demonstrate 
		that. I’ll also briefly run through how our barcode IDs where generated as well as the logic behind the program script used to activate the 
		barcode scanner.<br><br>

	<H3>Week 7 - Individual PCB Demo Due (Dec. 4th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, Dr Kristian shared a correction paper to correct some part of the PCB board (Cutting traces). A small wire was cut and soldered on the
	PCB board from one point to another, the wire bridged the two point on the PCB board. After the process, I was able to test my PCB at the protype lab to ensure that is working.
	<ul><li>Cutting the Trace on my PCB</li>
	 <img src="Trace.jpg" alt="Trace" style="width:400px;height:400px;"></ul>
	I got my PCB board set up with my raspberry pie. Dowloaded the file to my sd card following the specic process. Unfortunately I was unable to test the set up because of lack of HDMI cable.
	I explained to Dr Medri what happened, that am having midterm test immediately after the class, that i will do it as soon as am done the midterm.	
        After the test, i was able to get hdmi cable. I boot up my raspberry pie. 
        <ul>
	<li>I got the LED to blink using "sudo ./traffic2B"</li>
	<li>I got the light sensor to work using  "sudo ./ghmain"</li>
	<li>I got the "sudo hwclock -w" and "sudo hwclock -r" to work</li>
        <li>Blinking led</li>

	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 27th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (after strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 4th. I told Dr kristian about my situation that i will need help about my blog before he marked me on it, 
	i also i told him about the mark he gave me on my blog and aquisition, and he said he will work something out for me. 
	Since its very hard to create time to meet with Dr Medri for my blog, i was able to figured it out with the help of my coligues.I sent an email to prototype for my pcb board. I got my pcb board and i started working on it, i used the guide provided. This aspect was a great experience for me.

	<H3>Week 5 - Proof of Components Acquired (Nov 27th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (after strike), our various project-required materials were delivered and checked by the instructor this week. I explained to Dr Medri that i forgot my materials at home and he gave me mark only on my glasses.

	<p align="justify"> NO classes held this week</p>
	
	<H3>Week 4 - Individual Budget Report Due</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Budget Report for the Parts Crib Database project shows the all the infomation on cost for the required hardware 
	materials needed to set up a functional without USB barcode reader to read in linear barcode IDs into our web/mobile application. The main parts 
	required are just the Barcode Scanner Module with CCD Camera and the Raspberry PI 3 model kit which includes other sub parts like the 
	casing, the power adapter, a micro SD card, a micro SD USB reader and a HDMI cable. Below is a detailed display of the budget for each part.</p>

	<H3>Week 3 - Project Timeline Scheduling (Gantt Chart)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we submitted our Project Scheduling Report in a Gantt Chart format using Microsoft Project. 
        The project Schedule outlines the tasks and activities of the project; the duration; start and end dates for each individual task and the project as a whole; 
        and the resources and effort required. Developing a project Schedule involves a number of defined steps.</p>

	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Submission</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Proposal letter was submitted for an aproval. The proposal explained more on the project topic & background and most importantly the problem addressed and how to solve it. 
	components. The main objective of this proposal is to give a clear overview of listing of a project's milestones, activities, and deliverables, usually with intended start and finish.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p align="justify">The first day of the week  we started with a quize, installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, 
	cloned into our Github Desktop application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This 
	synchronized method of data storage between our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related 
	materials much more easier. We also set up individual web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to 
	upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
