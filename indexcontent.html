	<H3>Week 7 - Individual PCB Demo Due (Dec. 4th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, Mr Kristian shared a correction paper to correct some part of the PCB board (Cutting s trace). A small wire was cut and soldered on the
	PCB board from one point to another, the wire bridged the two point on the PCB board. After the process, i was able to test my PCB at the protype lab to ensure that is working.

	I got my PCB board set up with my raspberry pie. Dowloaded the file to my sd card following the specic process. Unfortunately i was unable to test the set up because of lack of HDMI cable.
	I explained to Mr Medri what happened, that am having midterm test immediately after the class, that i will do it as soon as am done the midterm.	
        After the test, i was able to get hdmi cable. I boot up my raspberry pie. 
        <ul>
	<li>I got the LED to blink using "sudo ./traffic2B"</li>
	<li>I got the light sensor to work using  "sudo ./ghmain"</li>
	<li>I got the "sudo hwclock -w" and "sudo hwclock -r" to work</li>

	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 27th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (After strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 4th. I told Mr kristian about my situation that i will need help about my blog before he marked me on it, 
	i also i told him about the mark he gave me on my blog and aquisition, and he said he will work something out for me. 
	Since its very hard to create time to meet with Mr Medri for my blog, i was able to figured it out with the help of my coligues.I sent an email to prototype for my pcb board. I got my pcb board and i started working on it, i used the guide provided. This aspect was a great experience for me.

	<H3>Week 5 - Proof of Components Acquired (Nov 27th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (After strike), our various project-required materials were delivered and checked by t
	he instructor this week. I explained to Mr Medri that i forgot my materials at home and he ticked only glasses for me.

	<H3>Week 4 - Individual Budget Report Due</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Budget Report for the Parts Crib Database project shows the all the infomation on cost for the required hardware 
	materials needed to set up a functional without USB barcode reader to read in linear barcode IDs into our web/mobile application. The main parts 
	required are just the Barcode Scanner Module with CCD Camera and the Raspberry PI 3 model kit which includes other sub parts like the 
	casing, the power adapter, a micro SD card, a micro SD USB reader and a HDMI cable. Below is a detailed display of the budget for each part.</p>

	<H3>Week 3 - Project Timeline Scheduling (Gantt Chart)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we submitted our Project Scheduling Report in a Gantt Chart format using Microsoft Project. 
        The project Schedule outlines the tasks and activities of the project; the duration; start and end dates for each individual task and the project as a whole; 
        and the resources and effort required. Developing a project Schedule involves a number of defined steps.</p>

	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Submission</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Proposal letter was submitted for an aproval. The proposal explained more on the project topic & background and most importantly the problem addressed and how to solve it. 
	components. The main objective of this proposal is to give a clear overview of listing of a project's milestones, activities, and deliverables, usually with intended start and finish.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p align="justify">The first day of the week  we started with a quize, installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, 
	cloned into our Github Desktop application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This 
	synchronized method of data storage between our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related 
	materials much more easier. We also set up individual web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to 
	upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
