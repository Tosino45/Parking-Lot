         <H3>Week 12 - Build Instructions(Jan. 22nd)</H3> 
	 <p allign="justify"> This week is the end of the project process for this Semester. The last on the schedule is the Build instructions.
         After setting up build system, the project is almost ready to be implemented, run the tests, and perform many other important functions. 
	 The next step is to develop a build process, which contains the instructions about how non usb scanner is going to function, what actions 
	 trigger a build, what tests to run, and any other procedures required.
	 <br><b>System Diagram</b></br>
         When planning a project a SYSTEM DIAGRAM is essential. This will allow you to show your thinking regarding your ideas and whether or not they
	 will answer the design problem. It also allows you to think systematically and logically  about the design problem and how it can be solved. 
	 Above all, it keeps you ‘on track’ and does not allow you to wander too far away from the original design problem. A systems diagram is similar
	 to a flow chart although on first sight it is much simpler and more precise. The diagram is usually part of either, the ideas or development sections. 
	 This Project mainly focus on this three part;

       <b><br>Time Commitment:</b></br>
        The time comitment for this project was followed at the begining. Due to some challenges along the way, i was behind for sometime,I try hard to catch up with the time comitment.
        The time allocated for this project is reasonable and easy to achieve, if concentration are been giving to the project, it is someting that i can finish lesser than the time. All things
        been equal, i was able to meet up with the time allocated for the project. Thanks to Prof Medri for the assistance and guidance. 
        <b><br>Pcb/Soldering:</b></br>
        This is the first step of the project, the Pcb was designed to be soldered by following the step giving to us by the Prof. This was done and at some point, there was correction made by the Prof 
        by cutting a trace to bridge some part of the pcb. After the soldering, it was test to make sure that it passed the necessary requirement.
        <b><br>Mechanical Assembly:</b></br>
        This was easy at some point because of constant assembly almost everyday. to assemble the project, i will need the equipment to be ready. Such as Pcb, Rasberry Pi, Vga to Hdmi, serial cable to usb, the scanner,
        external keyboard and mouse. 
        <li>Pcb to the Rasberry Pi</li>
        <li>Vga to the computer and hdmi to the rasberry pi </li>
        <li>external keyboard and mouse pluged to the rasberry pi</li>
        <li> Serial cable to the Scanner connected to the raspberry pi</li>
        <H3>Week 11 - Individual Final Presentations (Jan. 15th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, It is expected of us  to demo our final presentation with the project hardware all set up and working. The Powerpoint slides that will be used for the presentation are hyperlinked below.
	 I presented my presentation today, all went well and good. I also did manual demo too, when scanning the ID card the result pop up at the terminal.  </p>

 	<H3>Week 10 - Individual Progess Report Due (Jan 09)</H3>
 	<p align="justify">
 		<br><b>Work Achieved So Far:</b><br>
 		The goal of my Project is to provide a scanner for student ID barcode which was successful. After every stages in this project, I was able to implement a 
		non usb scanner that scans Id barcode. When the Scanner scans, it then pop  up the number.<br><br>
 		
 		<b>Recent project activities with reference to project schedule:</b><br>
		My project is completed to some extent at the moment. Though, I did not work accroding to my scheduling due to some challenges along the way, Over all it has been a challenging period
		but at last the project meet up with the reference to scheduling. However, i have an intention to build up a web application to read the scanning of the student barcode,
		this will triger the student information in the database. Right now the Scanner performs its obligation which is the main function by scanning student Id barcode into a terminal called Minicom..
 		<br><br>
 		
 		<b>Current progress in meeting project objectives as defined in proposal:</b><br>
		At the moment, the hardware functions fine, but the only thing is to build up a web application that run with a database, when the student ID is scanned, it bring out the information of the student.
		
 		<br><br>
 		
 		<b>Description of problems/opportunities encountered & solution plans:</b><br>
		I encoutered some problem along the way. From the building of the PCB to the hardware itself. My SD card was corrupted while i was trying to make a Video, I have to get another one then start it all over again.
		After recording the video, I tried to record the narration of the video, when I imported it to the video, I realised it is not working. I tried it several times. I complained to the Prof about it and he said i can upload it like that since i have a description that illustrated the Video.
 		<br><br>
 		
 		<b>Financial updates on project funds + significant budget variances:</b><br>
		For now, i have spent more than what i proposed. along the way, I realised that i have to buy a serial cable, serial to HDMI, network adapter, another SD card
		 I dont know what am going to meet later but as of now I have spent more than my budget.<br><br>

	<H3>Week 8 - Group Placard & Video Script (Dec. 11th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">The group placard and video scripts were expected to be due. The 
	group placard is a public display of a brief description of the Parts Crib Database + Non Usb Barcode Scanner project. It also shows 
	the list of hardware materials required for the set up as well as the names of the team members. Below are photos of the group placard as well
	as a brief outline of our script for the build video expected next week.</p>

	<LI>Explanation of the parts of the project and their major functions.</LI>
	<LI>Few seconds of how to set up and assemble each part together.</LI>
	<LI>Demonstration of power up and testing process with explanation of the functionality.</LI>

	 <br><b>Video Script Introduction:</b><br>
		The Start up screen titled "Parts crib Database + Non-Usb Barcode Scanner by my name will follow by brief introduction of the project.<br><br>
		
		A recent study on how equipment and tools are been borrowed from Part cribs of the engineering department shown that the process is not well organised, and not in line with the new technology.
                A projection of how students increase per year shown that at some point the manual way of lending this equipment will not be a better option.
	        I therefore want to introduce part cribs database which am focusing more on the hardware Non Usb Barcode scanner. This is a machine-readable strip of data printed in parallel lines, 
	        used to represent a multitude of information. Traditionally, the barcode scanner is meant to keep track of inventory and speed up data entry. 
	        Due to high volume of student usage, barcode scanning provide easy access, focusing on improving the efficiency, 
	        accuracy, and productivity of supply management. In contrast, I want to create an application that is users friendly. This application would function as a reader of barcode of student identity card.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the parts that arrived:</b><br>
	        These are the component which will fit together to build the entire project. I odered my parts from two different places. My raspberry pi 3 with its component
	        arrived at the cost of $98.00 from amazone with free shipping, Barcode scanner non usb arrived from Robotshop at the cost of almost $100.00 with shipping cost, 
	        I got my sd card from the source. They all arrived one week interver.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the parts assembly:</b><br>
		In other to assemble this part together, we will need some equipments for connection.
	       <li>Ethernet Cable</li>
	       <li>Usb to Ethernet cable adapter</li>
	       <li>HDMI cable with a VGA to Computer</li>
               <li>Identity card barcode</li> 
	        I started by setting up the raspberry pie with the PCB attached, 
	        I connected the internet cable to the raspberry pie to share connection with a device e.g Laptop,
	        I Connect the internet cable through the usb to ethernet cable adapter to the Laptop,
	        In other to view the raspberry pie on the computer I made use of HDMI cable with a VGA to the computer.
	        The non-usb barcode scanner is connected with one of the port in the raspberry pie.
	        Then I connected the power adapter and put the raspberry up.
	        At this stage the identity card barcode is ready for scanning.
	 
	      
		<b>A few seconds of the power up and the functionality you plan to demonstrate:</b><br>
		After connecting the Raspberry Pi’s power adapter for power up, we can switch views on the computer’s VGA settings till we can see the 
		Raspberry Pi’s power up process during load up. We’ll open up the Pi’s command line terminal and then load up the program files and scripts 
		needed to activate the USB barcode scanner’s functionality. At the moment, all we’re trying to do is ensure that the USB Barcode scanner can 
		successfully scan in printed barcode IDs into a web application’s text field and we already have a web application we can use to demonstrate 
		that. I’ll also briefly run through how our barcode IDs where generated as well as the logic behind the program script used to activate the 
		barcode scanner.<br><br>
	</p>

	<H3>Week 7 - Individual PCB Demo Due (Dec. 4th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, Dr Kristian shared a correction paper to correct some part of the PCB board (Cutting traces). A small wire was cut and soldered on the
	PCB board from one point to another, the wire bridged the two point on the PCB board. After the process, I was able to test my PCB at the protype lab to ensure that is working.
	<ul><li>Cutting the Trace on my PCB</li>
	 <img src="Trace.jpg" alt="Trace" style="width:400px;height:400px;"></ul>
	I got my PCB board set up with my raspberry pie. Dowloaded the file to my sd card following the specic process. Unfortunately I was unable to test the set up because of lack of HDMI cable.
	I explained to Dr Medri what happened, that am having midterm test immediately after the class, that i will do it as soon as am done the midterm.	
        After the test, i was able to get hdmi cable. I boot up my raspberry pie. 
        <ul>
	<li>I got the LED to blink using "sudo ./traffic2B"</li>
	<li>I got the light sensor to work using  "sudo ./ghmain"</li>
	<li>I got the "sudo hwclock -w" and "sudo hwclock -r" to work</li>
        <li>Blinking led</li>

	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 27th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (after strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 4th. I told Dr kristian about my situation that i will need help about my blog before he marked me on it, 
	i also i told him about the mark he gave me on my blog and aquisition, and he said he will work something out for me. 
	Since its very hard to create time to meet with Dr Medri for my blog, i was able to figured it out with the help of my coligues.I sent an email to prototype for my pcb board. I got my pcb board and i started working on it, i used the guide provided. This aspect was a great experience for me.
