	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 24th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (After strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 1st. During the strike, due to lack of resources to proceed with the soldering process and the assembling 
	of the hardware materials, we decided to keep working on the project by developing the web application and mobile application, which will 
	serve as a medium of communication between our hardware product and our online remote server. This aspect is also yet to be completed. Below
	is a link to our progress so far.</p>

	<H3>Week 4 - Individual Budget Report Due</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Budget Report for the Parts Crib Database project shows the all the infomation on cost for the required hardware 
	materials needed to set up a functional without USB barcode reader to read in linear barcode IDs into our web/mobile application. The main parts 
	required are just the Barcode Scanner Module with CCD Camera and the Raspberry PI 3 model kit which includes other sub parts like the 
	casing, the power adapter, a micro SD card, a micro SD USB reader and a HDMI cable. Below is a detailed display of the budget for each part.</p>

	<H3>Week 3 - Project Timeline Scheduling (Gantt Chart)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we submitted our Project Scheduling Report in a Gantt Chart format using Microsoft Project. 
        The project Schedule outlines the tasks and activities of the project; the duration; start and end dates for each individual task and the project as a whole; 
        and the resources and effort required. Developing a project Schedule involves a number of defined steps.</p>

	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Submission</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Proposal letter was submitted for an aproval. The proposal explained more on the project topic & background and most importantly the problem addressed and how to solve it. 
	components. The main objective of this proposal is to give a clear overview of listing of a project's milestones, activities, and deliverables, usually with intended start and finish.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p align="justify">The first day of the week  we started with a quize, installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, 
	cloned into our Github Desktop application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This 
	synchronized method of data storage between our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related 
	materials much more easier. We also set up individual web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to 
	upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
