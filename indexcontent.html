	<H3>Week 7 - Individual PCB Demo Due (Dec. 4th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">To be updated soon.</p>
	
	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 24th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (After strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 1st. During the strike, due to lack of resources to proceed with the soldering process and the assembling 
	of the hardware materials, we decided to keep working on the project by developing the web application and mobile application, which will 
	serve as a medium of communication between our hardware product and our online remote server. This aspect is also yet to be completed. Below
	is a link to our progress so far.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p align="justify">The first day of the week  we started with a quize, installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, 
	cloned into our Github Desktop application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This 
	synchronized method of data storage between our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related 
	materials much more easier. We also set up individual web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to 
	upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
