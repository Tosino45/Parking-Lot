	<H3>Week 7 - Individual PCB Demo Due (Dec. 4th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">To be updated soon.</p>
	
	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 24th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (After strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 1st. During the strike, due to lack of resources to proceed with the soldering process and the assembling 
	of the hardware materials, we decided to keep working on the project by developing the web application and mobile application, which will 
	serve as a medium of communication between our hardware product and our online remote server. This aspect is also yet to be completed. Below
	is a link to our progress so far.</p>

	<H3>Week 5 - Proof of Components Acquired (Oct. 13th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (Before strike), our various project-required materials were delivered and checked by the instructor this week. 
	Mine specifically was a Raspberry Pi 3 Console from CanaKit and a USB compatible Barcode Scanner module by AdaFruit. We also requested for 
	our PCB Board and Student Sense Hat kits from the Parts Crib. We edited and sent the schematic guide for the board to them and picked it up 
	a few days later. At the moment, we're still in the soldering process and we expect it to be finished and tested after the upcoming strike.</p>

	<H3>Week 5 - Progress Report (Reading Days Holiday)</H3>
	<p align="justify"> No classes held this week</p>
	
	<H3>Week 4 - Individual Budget Report Due</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Budget Report for the Parts Crib Database project shows the all the infomation on cost for the required hardware 
	materials needed to set up a functional USB barcode reader to read in linear barcode IDs into our web/mobile application. The main parts 
	required are just the USB Barcode Scanner Module with CCD Camera and the Raspberry PI 3 model kit which includes other sub parts like the 
	casing, the power adapter, a micro SD card, a micro SD USB reader and a HDMI cable. Below is a detailed display of the budget for each part.</p>

	<H3>Week 3 - Project Timeline Scheduling (Gantt Chart)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we handed in our Project Scheduling Report in a Gantt Chart format using Microsoft Project. It shows a 
	collection of project-related tasks with their individual start dates and finish dates as well as their predecessors and time durations. 
	It covers the 2 courses in different semesters i.e. CENG 317 and CENG 355 from Semester 5 and 6. Most of these tasks are dependent on the 
	previous tasks (the week before), and they are to be completed on a weekly basis. Once in a while there could be cause to drift away from 
	the normal planned schedule. But for now, this is how myself and my group plan to operate.</p>

	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Submission</H3>
	<p align="justify">We handed in a Proposal letter for the approval of our selected project i.e. The Parts Crib Database, based on a 
	specific template given to us by the instructor. The proposal sheds light on the project topic & background, the intended purchases, the 
	budgeting, and most importantly the problem addressed. It also explains in detail, how we plan to develop and bring different technical 
	components together to function as one. These components include our database, the web application, mobile application and some Hardware 
	components. The main objective of this proposal is to give a clear overview of how this project is planned to unfold from start to finish.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we started off with the installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, 
	cloned into our Github Desktop application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This 
	synchronized method of data storage between our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related 
	materials much more easier. We also set up individual web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to 
	upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
